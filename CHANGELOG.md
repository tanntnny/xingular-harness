# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Add one native asynchronous subagent service for SDK, RPC and standalone terminal callers, with selective waits, parent joins, typed history receipts and explicit-resume recovery.
- Preserve capability ceilings and route child approvals/questions through the owning terminal; release pending interactions before SDK abort.

- Harness owns the standalone terminal frontend, using persistent Pi 1.2.0 sessions and the inspected Oh My Pi 18.11.3 presentation.
- Add titanium and light themes, native session navigation, local command help and completion, account/plugin/Hub controls, and trusted extension UI hosting.
- Keep account isolation, exact prepared context and resource selection, the final tool gate, native histories and Harness run recording.
- Support grouped questions with atomic answers, cancellation and restored draft focus.
- Isolate stale plugin UI callbacks across session replacement and resource reload; restore terminal modes after fatal asynchronous failures and cleanup errors.

Implementation and verification limits are recorded in [the terminal reference](docs/terminal-tui.md).
